## Purpose

Built from the react-instant-chat app with modifications for the purposes of the ASAPP front-end challenge.

This was incredibly fun and I would like to thank you for giving me the opportunity to apply at ASAPP.

## Requirements

Ensure that you also have the [bishr-chat-api](https://github.com/abishr12/bishr-chat-api) running as well

## Running The Chat App

To start the app, run:

```
npm install

npm start
```

Ensure that you also have the [bishr-chat-api](https://github.com/abishr12/bishr-chat-api) running as well

Once the webpack server has started you can access it in a browser at http://localhost:8000/webpack-dev-server/

## Using The Chat App

### Opening the App

Open the app on two separate browsers

NOTE: I know the requirement had the chat on one tab. However, I felt for testing purposes (and when it would go into production) that the chat would be better served simulating two separate users at two separate locations

### Typing Indication

While typing you'll see the typing indicator (based off of Apple's iMessage) indicating that the other user is typing along with timestamps for incoming messages
